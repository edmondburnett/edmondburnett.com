Hello, I'm a Software Engineer based in Seattle, WA. I enjoy writing about technical topics related to my work and play
in code, infrastructure, and systems, or making observations on the industry.

My recent programming work is primarily in Python, Rust, and TypeScript. I also use or have used Go (Golang), C, C++,
Lua, Bash, C#, various Lisps and esolangs, and others. Daily tools include Arch Linux, macOS, Neovim, sometimes Emacs
(particularly for Lisps).

## Hire me

Currently open for work in Backend or Fullstack Software Engineering roles. I'm also highly skilled in production
infrastructure & ops. Connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edmondburnett/).

## About this site

This site serves as one of several extensions of my personal writing and note-taking system (or Zettelkasten), whenever
I feel like posting about work or technical subjects in a (b)log-like format.

It's written in Rust with axum and tokio. View the [source code](https://github.com/edmondburnett/edmondburnett.com).
