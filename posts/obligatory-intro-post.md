The first post on a new blog is often the most difficult, if not awkward due to the fact that none of the interesting
stuff that naturally comes later has actually happened yet. Not to mention most readers who encounter this post will be
doing so long after it was written. Introductions really mean very little in the online world, especially when we have
yet to establish the usefulness of a fresh and unpoven personal outlet. So why are we always preparing? Let's just go.

Sometime in the late 80's my father brought home a Commodore PC-20. It had a word processor, Hangman, and 640K of
memory. Things became considerably more interesting when I discovered what a modem was, and started learning the Hayes
command set to log into local dial-up BBS's through a POTS telephone line. For an 8 year old kid, finding this whole
other world out there was incredibly exciting. Me and my friends promptly began tying up phone lines for days on end,
downloading warez, discovering early digital art and music, playing ASCII games, and communicating with total strangers.
There were lots of busy signals in those days.

Programming was another thing that I stumbled upon pretty early. Getting started in coding was a different beast back
then, and tracking down the limited learning resources and documentation required a bit of sleuthing. My Tandy 386sx had
MS-DOS with QBasic (remember GOTO statements?), and I eventually figured out enough to cobble together a crude text game
or two. When a copy of Borland Turbo C fell into my hands, I started writing little shareware utilities, BBS door games,
and other experiments.

Perhaps the most important aspect about all of this was that it represented freedom. Here was this new universe where a
kid could explore, communicate, learn, and experiment without rules, without supervision, without fear. Except for a
friend or two, nobody in my life back then really knew or understood what it was we were doing when we spent so much
time using computers. Most other kids thought it was dumb, even something deserving of mockery - but we didn't care. It
felt like we were taking part in some special enigma that few were privy to.

Fast forward to 2014, and things seem to have changed slightly. Technology is no doubt still incredibly interesting, but
I can't help but think that the limitless freedom and potential it represents is being swiftly torpedoed by certain
corporate & political interests, and societal decision makers who themselves barely manage to understand technical
matters at even the most casual level, let alone respect the driving philosophy that made it happen in the first place.

## Something resembling a Mission Statement

Over the past year or so I feel like I've been consistently inspired, and accumulating enough ideas for articles, that
I'm ready to jump back into doing some regular technical writing.

The primary topics I intend to cover include programming, Linux, cryptography, security & privacy, the FOSS movement,
digital rights, the software industry, computing history, and related areas. Some other conversations of personal
interest may occasionally make an appearance. This proposed direction will no doubt evolve over time.

I've hammered together a minimalist blogging platform. This is a content-centric blog intentionally chopped down to it's
bare essentials. Along those lines, I'm forgoing a comments section, at least for now, and trying something different by
asking readers to e-mail me their comments instead.

I'm looking forward to this. Thanks for reading.
